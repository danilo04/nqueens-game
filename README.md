# N-Queens Game üëë

An interactive Android chess puzzle game built with Jetpack Compose where players solve the classic N-Queens problem by placing queens on a chessboard so that no two queens attack each other.

## üéØ About

The N-Queens puzzle is a classic computer science problem where the challenge is to place N chess queens on an N√óN chessboard so that no two queens can attack each other. This means no two queens can be:
- On the same row
- On the same column  
- On the same diagonal

This mobile game implementation allows players to:
- Choose board sizes from 4√ó4 to 12√ó12
- Interactively place and remove queens
- Get visual feedback for invalid placements
- Track their solving progress and times
